# ninetailed-vue-resources
A collection of resources engineering teams to implement Ninetailed with Vue

This repository contains resources for setting up Ninetailed within an Vue (2) application. The repository is divided into three parts:

1. The `/vue-starter` directory, containing an example minimum viable setup for Ninetailed. I recommend looking at the Personalize.vue component.
2. A `/react` directory, for showing the abstractions we use in our React SDK to provide an <Experience> component.
3. A `steps.md` file containing the instructions I sent over during our call in a more legible format.
